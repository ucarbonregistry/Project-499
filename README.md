The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity.
The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG’s) into the
atmosphere, which is estimated to be approximately 18,251 tCO2e per year, by displacing the
equivalent amount of electricity generation estimated i.e. 23,232 MWh/yr through the operation of
existing fuel mix in the grid comprising mainly fossil fuel based power plants and future capacity
expansions connected to the grid.

The project activity is set up to produce clean power from the wind energy converters (WEC’s).
The project activity involves supply, erection, commissioning and operation of 18 machines of
rated capacity 800 kW each. The machines are Enercon E-53 make. The WEGs generates 3-phase
power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 kV. The Project can operate in the frequency range of
47.5–51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%. The electricity generated by project
activity will be pooled to Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation Ltd.
The project activity consists of 18 WEGs (800 kW) of Enercon make E-53. The first machine under
the project activity was commissioned on 29 September 2011 and last machine under the project
activity was commissioned on 31 January 2012. The commissioning dates for all the machines
include in the project activity are given in the table below.
